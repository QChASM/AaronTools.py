# AaronTools.py
This Python implimentation of AaronTools provides a collection of tools for automating routine tasks encountered when running quantum chemistry computations.

These tools can be used either directly within a Python script using AaronTools objects, or via a series of command-line scripts. 

See the <a href="https://github.com/QChASM/AaronTools.py/wiki">Wiki</a> for installation and usage.

A Perl implementation of AaronTools is also <a href="https://github.com/QChASM/AaronTools">available here.</a>
However, users are strongly urged to use the Python version since it has far more powerful features and, unlike the Perl version, will continue to be developed and supported.
